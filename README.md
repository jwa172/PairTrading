# PairTrading

This repository contains code for implementing a pair trading strategy based on the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) framework. The strategy involves identifying co-integrated asset pairs, modeling their spread using an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, and determining optimal trading thresholds to maximize expected returns while minimizing risk.
